TRUE OR FALSE
 1. Most computers typically fall into one of three types of CPU
 organization: (1) general register organization; (2) single accumulator
 organization; or (3) stack organization.
True

 2. The advantage of zero-address instruction computers is that they have
 short programs; the disadvantage is that the instructions require
 many bits, making them very long.
false

 3. An instruction takes less time to execute on a processor using an
 instruction pipeline than on a processor without an instruction
 pipeline.
true

 4. The term “endian” refers to an architecture’s byte ordering.
true

 5. Stack architectures have good code density and a simple model for
 evaluation of expressions, but do not allow random access, which can
 cause a problem with the generation of efficient code.
true

 6. Most architectures today are accumulator based.


 7. Fixed-length instruction format typically results in better
 performance than variable-length instruction format.


 8. Expanding opcodes make instruction decoding much easier than
 when it is not used.


 9. Instruction set orthogonality refers to the characteristic in an
 instruction set architecture where each instruction has a “backup”
 instruction that performs the same operation.


 10. The effective address of an operand is the value of its actual address in
 memory.


 11. Resource conflicts occur in a pipeline when there are multiple
 instructions that require the same resource.


 12. Data dependencies occur in a pipeline when multiple instructions
 need the CPU
