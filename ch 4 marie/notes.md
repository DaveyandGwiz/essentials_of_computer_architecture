REVIEW OF ESSENTIAL TERMS
AND CONCEPTS
1. What is the function of a CPU?
Fetch and decode instructions.
 The main task of the Central Processing Unit (CPU) is to retrieve program instructions, understand and decipher them and perform the indicated sequence of operations on the correct data.

• The CPU is divided into datapath and control unit.

2. What purpose does a datapath serve?
The datapath is basically an intricate interconnection of arithmetic and logic units (ALU) and storage units which are connected by buses whose timings of data transfer are controlled by the CPU clock.

3. What does the control unit do?
The control unit oversees the chronological ordering of operations and makes sure that the appropriate data are at the right place at the right time.

4. Where are registers located, and what are the different types?
Registers are located in the CPU. Registers have types of general-purpose and specialized.
An example of a special purpose regiters, for example in mIPS architecture, is $zero which is hardwired to yield a value of zero.

5. How does the ALU know which function to perform?
The ALU relies on control signals generated by the Control Unit, based on the opcode of the current instruction. These signals tell the ALU which operation to perform, ensuring that the correct computation or logic function is executed.

6. Why is a bus often a communications bottleneck?

A bus can become a communications bottleneck because:
    Shared Medium: All devices connected to the bus must share the same communication channel, limiting the number of simultaneous transfers.
    Limited Bandwidth: The bus has a fixed bandwidth, which can be insufficient for high-speed or high-volume data transfers in modern systems.
    Contention: Multiple devices may compete to use the bus, causing delays as devices wait for access.
    Latency: The time taken to arbitrate and transfer data on the bus can slow overall system performance.

7. What is the difference between a point-to-point bus and a multipoint bus?

Point-to-Point Bus:
    A dedicated connection between two devices.
    Provides higher bandwidth and avoids contention.
    Example: Connections between a CPU and GPU via PCIe.

Multipoint Bus:
    Shared by multiple devices.
    More cost-effective and simpler but introduces contention and potential delays.
    Example: Traditional system buses like the PCI bus.

8. Why is a bus protocol important?
A bus protocol defines the rules for communication on a bus, ensuring orderly and efficient data transfer. It is important because:

    Coordination: Ensures that devices communicate without conflicts, especially on multipoint buses.
    Data Integrity: Specifies how data is sent, received, and acknowledged to avoid corruption.
    Timing: Provides rules for synchronization, ensuring devices operate correctly at different speeds.
    Device Compatibility: Ensures that devices from different manufacturers can interoperate on the same bus.

9. Explain the differences between data buses, address buses, and control buses.

Data Bus:
    Carries actual data being transferred between components.
    Bi-directional, as data can move to or from the CPU.
    Example: Transferring an instruction from memory to the CPU.
Address Bus:
    Carries the memory or I/O addresses to specify the location for data read/write.
    Uni-directional, as the CPU typically generates the addresses.
    Example: Sending a memory address to RAM to fetch data.
Control Bus:
    Carries control signals to manage and coordinate data transfer.
    Signals include read/write operations, interrupts, and clock pulses.
    Example: Telling a device to start or stop a transfer.

10. What is a bus cycle?
A bus cycle refers to the sequence of steps required to transfer data or instructions across a bus. It typically includes:
    Address Phase: The CPU places the memory or I/O address on the address bus.
    Control Phase: Control signals indicate the type of operation (e.g., read or write).
    Data Phase: The actual data is transferred on the data bus.
    The speed of bus cycles affects the overall performance of the system. Faster bus cycles mean quicker communication between components.

11. Name three different types of buses and where you would find them.
12. What is the difference between synchronous buses and
nonsynchronous buses?

13. What are the four types of bus arbitration?
Bus arbitration determines which device gains control of the bus in a multipoint system when multiple devices request access simultaneously. The four types are:

Centralized Arbitration:
    A single arbiter (usually part of the CPU or a separate device) decides which device gets access.
    Example: PCI bus.

Distributed Arbitration:
    All devices participate in the arbitration process and communicate directly to resolve conflicts.
    Example: Ethernet using collision detection.

Priority-Based Arbitration:
    Devices are assigned priorities, and higher-priority devices gain access first.
    Example: Used in systems where certain devices (e.g., interrupts) require faster responses.

Round-Robin Arbitration:
    Access is granted in a rotating order to ensure fairness among devices.
    Example: Found in some multiprocessor systems to balance load.
    Each arbitration method balances trade-offs between fairness, performance, and complexity.

14. Explain the difference between clock cycles and clock frequency.
Duration of a single tick of the system. It is the smallest unit of the system in which operations can be performed.
The frequency of the clock, or the clock frequency, is the number of clock cycles per second.

15. Difference Between System Clocks and Bus Clocks
System Clock:
    The system clock regulates the CPU and other core components, ensuring that instructions and processes execute in sync.
    Operates at a high frequency (e.g., 3 GHz for modern CPUs) to match the speed of the processor.
Bus Clock:
    The bus clock governs the timing of data transfers on the system bus, which connects the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
    Typically runs at a lower frequency than the system clock to match the slower speeds of external devices.
    Some modern systems use a multiplier to link the bus clock to the system clock (e.g., a 200 MHz bus clock with a 15x multiplier gives a 3 GHz system clock).

16. What is the function of an I/O interface?
The function of an I/O interface is to act as a bridge between the CPU/memory and external input/output devices. It facilitates:
    Data Transfer: Manages the exchange of data between the CPU and I/O devices.
    Signal Conversion: Translates signals between the CPU’s digital format and the device’s native format.
    Synchronization: Resolves timing differences between the high-speed CPU and slower I/O devices.
    Control and Monitoring: Handles control signals to manage device operations and monitors the status of devices.
    Interrupt Handling: Coordinates the CPU’s response to interrupts generated by I/O devices.

17. Explain the difference between memory-mapped I/O and instructionbased I/O.
    Memory-Mapped I/O: The CPU treats I/O devices like memory, using memory instructions to interact with them.
    Instruction-Based I/O: The CPU uses dedicated I/O instructions for communication with I/O devices.


18. What is the difference between a byte and a word? What distinguishes
each?
A byte is 8 bits. A word is a size dependent on a given architecutre. It is the size of an instruction in the system. 
It's size varies from 8 all the way to 64 or more which is common.

19. Explain the difference between byte addressable and word
addressable.
In a byte addressable system, each byte in memory has a unique address, while in word addressable memory only every word has an address 
where a word is the size of an instruction in memory. Most systems are byte addressabel which requires that more bits in each
 instruction be used for the address.
