 1. Which is faster, SRAM or DRAM?
 2. What are the advantages of using DRAM for main memory?
 3. Name three different applications where ROMs are often used.
 4. Explain the concept of a memory hierarchy. Why did your authors
 choose to represent it as a pyramid?

 to memory systems.
 6. What are the three forms of locality?
 7. Give two noncomputer examples of the concept of cache.
 8. Which of L1 or L2 cache is faster? Which is smaller? Why is it smaller?
 9. Cache is accessed by its _______, whereas main memory is accessed
 by its _______.
 10. What are the three fields in a direct-mapped cache address? How are
 they used to access a word located in cache?
 11. How does associative memory differ from regular memory? Which is
 more expensive and why?
 12. Explain how fully associative cache is different from direct-mapped
 cache.
 13. Explain how set-associative cache combines the ideas of direct and
 fully associative cache.
 14. Direct-mapped cache is a special case of set-associative cache where
 the set size is 1. So fully associative cache is a special case of set
associative cache where the set size is ______.
 15. What are the three fields in a set-associative cache address, and how
 are they used to access a location in cache?

 policies.

 25. What are the advantages of a Harvard cache?
 26. Why would a system contain a victim cache? A trace cache?
 27. Explain the differences among L1, L2, and L3 cache.
 28. Explain the differences between inclusive and exclusive cache.
 29. What is the advantage of a nonblocking cache?
 30. What is the difference between a virtual memory address and a
 physical memory address? Which is larger? Why?
