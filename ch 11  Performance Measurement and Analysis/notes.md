11.2 Performance equations

cpu time:

time/program = time/cycle x cycles/instruction x intstructions/program


For increasing the overall performance of a system, we have the following options:
    CPU optimization—Maximize the speed and efficiency of operations
    performed by the CPU (the performance equation addresses this
    optimization).
    Memory optimization—Maximize the efficiency of a code’s memory
    management.
    I/O optimization—Maximize the efficiency of input/output
    operations
