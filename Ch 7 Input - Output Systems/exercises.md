 1. Calculate the overall speedup of a system that spends 65% of its time on I/O with a disk upgrade that provides for 50% greater throughput.

Amdhall's Law:
S = 1 / [(1-f)+(f/k)]

where   
    S = overall system speedup
    f = fraction of work performed by he faster compnent
    k = speedup of the new componet


Speedup = 1 / ( (1-0.65)+(0.65/1.5) ) = 1.28
